This repository is made to apply for Provectus's 2021 internship 

The idea of the script:

    1) I made 4 arrays for {first_name, last_name, birthts, image path}, and each of these arrays was technically an array of tuples to store the userID with it.
    
    2) The script reads all files in the folder containing the demo data, handles .csv and .png files separately, and stores the data it needs in the arrays. 
    
    3) Finally, it sorts the arrays by userID and outputs the data in the order specified in the "processed_date" csv file.
